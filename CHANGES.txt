    parsing french tooltips for duration fix
    
    I haven't tested cUseTooltipLineFormat and cUseDurationTooltipLineFormat2, but there should be spaces around the colon (and it's the case of several items I have which match cUseDurationTooltipLineFormat).
    Also for cUseDurationTooltipLineFormat, french for "seconds" is "secondes", but I have only seen the short "sec." on my items.
